			HueCanvas is an iPad application that enables users to control
			their lighting environments with the Philips Hue smart lighting
			system. This is achieved through an intuitive, gesture-based UI
			that is malleable and space oriented.

						<p class="about-content">
							With the proliferation of mobile devices and
							internet-connected appliances
							(the “Internet of Things”, or IoT), people are
							increasingly able to interact with and effect changes in
							their physical environments in new and interesting ways.
							Because of the ubiquity and outsize role of lighting in
							people’s everyday lives, smart lighting control was an
							obvious early entrant into the IoT space, with Philips
							introducing their Hue lighting system in October 2012.
							With each Hue bulb capable of producing any of 16 million
							colors, the Hue system promised users unprecedented control
							over their lighting environments.
						</p>
						<p class="about-content">
							While the lighting products themselves are extremely
							capable, the software implementations to control them
							have been lacking. To-date, the majority of Hue apps rely
							on a list-based interface to control lights, with many
							actions and parameter settings nested deep within menus.
							This results in a tedious and frustrating user experience.
