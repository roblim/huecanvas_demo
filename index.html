		<p class="about-content">
			With the proliferation of mobile devices and
			internet-connected appliances
			(the “Internet of Things”, or IoT), people are
			increasingly able to interact with and effect changes in
			their physical environments in new and interesting ways.
			Because of the ubiquity and outsize role of lighting in
			people’s everyday lives, smart lighting control was an
			obvious early entrant into the IoT space, with Philips
			introducing their Hue lighting system in October 2012.
			With each Hue bulb capable of producing any of 16 million
			colors, the Hue system promised users unprecedented control
			over their lighting environments.

			<p class="about-content">
				While the lighting products themselves are extremely
				capable, the software implementations to control them
				have been lacking. To-date, the majority of Hue apps rely
				on a list-based interface to control lights, with many
				actions and parameter settings nested deep within menus.
				This results in a tedious and frustrating user experience.
